# Files Manager
This project repository is a summary of my back-end specialization trimester at [ALX](https://alxafrica.com). The concepts leveraged in the implementation of the files manager program are as follows:
- Authentication
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Pagination
- Background processing/Caching/Logging

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:
- User authentication via a token
- List all files
- Upload a new file
- Change permission of a file
- View a file
- Generate thumbnails for images
